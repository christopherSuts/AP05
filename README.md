## Traffic Light Management System using VHDL


## (ðŸŽ“ Introduction)
The Adaptive Traffic Light System is a VHDL implementation that provides an intelligent traffic light control mechanism. It takes into account various factors such as road traffic, pedestrian crossings, and an elderly cross button to dynamically adjust the traffic light timings for optimal traffic flow and safety.


## Table Of Contents

Features
- Adaptive Timing   : The system adapts traffic light timings based on real-time inputs.
- Modular Design    : VHDL modules are used for modular and organized code.
- Pedestrian Safety : Includes support for pedestrian crossings and an elderly cross button.
- Scalable          : Can be adapted for different intersection configurations.
## Requirements

**VHDL synthesis tool** (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, Altera Quartus)
**FPGA development board** (optional for hardware implementation)
**Simulation tool** (e.g., ModelSim) for testing
## Usage

- Modify the VHDL parameters to suit your intersection configuration.
- Synthesize the design using your VHDL synthesis tool.
- Load the synthesized design onto your FPGA board (if applicable).
- Run simulations to validate the functionality.




## ðŸ”— Simulations
- Simulation files are provided to test the functionality of the VHDL code. Use a simulation tool like ModelSim to run the simulations and verify the correct behavior of the adaptive traffic light system.
