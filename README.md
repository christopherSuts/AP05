Traffic Light Controller in VHDL
This repository contains a simple implementation of a traffic light controller using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The project is intended to be used with FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) development boards.

Overview
The traffic light controller is a digital design that simulates the behavior of a typical traffic light system, including red, yellow, and green signals for both directions.

Features
Sequential state machine design
Modular VHDL code for easy understanding and modification
Simulated and tested using a VHDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim)
Suitable for FPGA deployment on various development boards
